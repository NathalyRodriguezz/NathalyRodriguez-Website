        <p class="lead mb-4">Nathaly Rodriguez is a current student at the University of California Riverside. She plans to major in Marketing with a focus on culture and media studies. For over 12 years, she has been dancing, choreographing, editing, and drawing. For the  past 3 years she has compiled a movie list in which she drives herself to watch as many movies as she can. An interesting and important fact about her is that her favorite movie is Shrek 2. Her hobbies include drawing, learning new instruments and languages, and viewing films. Due to that, she is very fond of the arts and entertainment industry. This attachment has driven her to become dedicated, versatile, and creative. Looking to seek employment after graduation, her college goals include obtaining an internship and engaging in current trends. She currently resided in Los Angeles, California, and is seeking experience. She takes pride in being a Mexican-American by being heavily involved in the culture, and being bilingual in English and Spanish. <br><br>

        Prior to her pre-buisness days, during her high school years, she took the opportunity to involve herself in several clubs, sports, and courses. She was apart of the Spanish Club, where she held the secretary position. Her responsibilities as secretary were to compile information prior to and during club meetings, manage events and sales, and take organized notes of important meetings, dates, and events. She was also in Leadership, where she was in the Eco and event organizer committee. Weekly she would collect and organize recycle collection from all classes on campus. For every event, game, or holiday she had to promote and arrange games and activities to bring school spirit. Lastly, she was in two dance teams on campus. One was Top-Notch Hip hop, and the other was Verdugo Hills Dance Company. She was a leader who mentored, rehearsed, and assisted in dance practices for the hip-hop team. And for the Verdugo Hills Dance Company, she worked alongside a team of students whose primary purpose was to promote and create a show. She was a choreographer who taught and learned from other dancers. Apart from clubs, she was also in the Verdugo Hills Girls Basketball team and Softball team. She and her softball teammates won first place in all three seasons.<br><br>

        She was once a Social Media Director for a fan page, in which she raised over 3,400 followers. In this fan page, she created artistic content, drawings, and posts. She promoted the instagram page and worked alongside other pages in collaborations. Managing her page and interacting with followers were a primary part of her role. She was also the founder and vice-president of ‚ÄúSeeds‚Äù Club, in which she opened a thrift store on campus and the earning were donated to charity. The club collected clothing and sold them in a store they created on campus. She was in charge of promoting the club, organizing supplies, filing paperwork, and maintaining club spirit.
